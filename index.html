                    <p>I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, right beside the beautiful South Mountains. So many amazing
                        landscapes and scenery are in Arizona and from that, I was inspired to create works of art.
                        After graduating highschool I studied at Arizona State University, majoring in Art Studies. I
                        took several classes involving computers, design, and technololgy. During the course of my
                        college career
                        I became very interested in computers and how they function. I'm discovering a new passion for
                        technology and learning the language behind it all.
                        I chose to attend the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp as my first step into learning to
                        code. I'm eager to see the opportunities that will come
                        with this new career change. </p>
                    <p>Some interesting things about me might come as a surprise. At the age of 23 I got the chickenpox,
                        which is more common when you are a child, but is very painful as an adult.i was vaccinated as a
                        child,
                        however my immune system was weak and the vaccination did not take. Another thing about me is I
                        love animals. I have a cat, three dogs, two birds and a desert tortoise. i like to donate to
                        animals
                        shelters whenever I can and I always try to help strays or lost animals if possible. My
                        interests include drawing, photography and playing music. I love to draw, especially cartoons.
                        adding youre own
                        twist to a drawing makes it stand out and have meaning. I am into wildlife photgraphy and
                        landscape photography, but I prefer traditional photography, using chemicals and a dark room.
                        I started playing music in middle school and throughout my highschool years, it will always be a
                        passion of mine to play.
